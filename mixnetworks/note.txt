Implement the De-anonymizing Mixed Networks assignment in this directory.

Solver entrypoint is mixnetworks/solve.py
(Implementation lives in mixnetworks/disclosure_attack/solve.py)

Example usage (from repo root):

- python .\mixnetworks\solve.py --nazir 147.9.13.37 --mix 148.4.53.119 --partners 3 --pcap .\mixnetworks\disclosure_attack\cia.log.10.pcap

No-args default mode:

- If you run `python .\mixnetworks\solve.py` with no arguments, it will read:
	- mixnetworks/nazir.txt (Nazir IP)
	- mixnetworks/mix.txt (Mix IP)
	- mixnetworks/partners.txt (number of partners)
	- mixnetworks/pcap.pcap (pcap file)

Output is a single integer: the sum of the partner IPs interpreted as 32-bit big-endian integers.
